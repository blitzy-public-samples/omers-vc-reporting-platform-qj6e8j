# OMERS Ventures Backend Platform

## Overview

This backend platform is designed to manage financial reporting metrics for OMERS Ventures' portfolio companies. It includes services for data ingestion, transformation, and retrieval, leveraging Azure's cloud infrastructure for scalability and security.

## Components

- **Authentication Service:** Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **API Gateway:** Centralized entry point for API requests, routing them to appropriate services.
- **Metrics Input Service:** Handles the ingestion and management of financial metrics data.
- **Reporting Financials Service:** Provides access to currency-adjusted financial metrics.
- **Reporting Metrics Service:** Serves derived financial metrics for analysis.
- **Data Transformation:** Automates the calculation of derivative metrics using Azure Functions.
- **Infrastructure:** Defined using Terraform for consistent and repeatable deployments.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the setup instructions in each service's README file to configure and run the individual components:
   - [Authentication Service README](src/backend/authentication_service/README.md)
