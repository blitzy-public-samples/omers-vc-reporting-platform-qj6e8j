"""
Initialization module for the data transformation function in Azure Functions.

This file sets up the necessary configurations and imports for the data transformation logic,
ensuring that all components are correctly initialized and ready for execution within the
Azure Functions environment.

Requirements Addressed:
    - Data Transformation Processes (Technical Requirements/Feature 3: Data Transformation Processes)
      Automate the retrieval of foreign exchange rates and calculation of derivative financial
      metrics to enhance data accuracy and reduce manual intervention.

Dependencies:
    - transform_data (from src.functions.data_transformation.main): Core data transformation logic
    - azure-functions (version: latest): Execute serverless data transformation scripts
