"""
Initialization module for the test suite of the data transformation function.

This file sets up the testing environment and configurations necessary for executing
unit tests on the data transformation logic within the Azure Functions environment.

Requirements Addressed:
    - Automated Testing and Quality Assurance
      Location: Technical Requirements/Feature 13: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance
      Description: Implement automated testing frameworks and quality assurance processes
                   to ensure the reliability and robustness of the backend platform.

Dependencies:
    - pytest (latest): Used for writing and executing unit tests to validate the
                       functionality of the data transformation logic.
    - transform_data (from src/functions/data_transformation/main.py):
      To test the core data transformation logic including currency conversion
      and derivative calculations.

Notes:
    This file should be updated with any changes to the test suite or testing
    configurations to ensure accurate and up-to-date testing procedures.
