# This file provides a template for environment variables required by the Reporting Financials Service.
# It includes placeholders for sensitive information such as database connection strings and API keys,
# which are essential for configuring the service in different environments.

# Requirements addressed:
# - API Development and Deployment (Technical Requirements/Feature 2: API Development and Deployment)
#   Develop and deploy the FastAPI-based RESTful API to facilitate secure and efficient data ingestion
#   and retrieval from the PostgreSQL database.

# Note: This is a sample file. Do not store actual sensitive information in this file.
# Create a .env file based on this template and populate it with real values for each environment.
