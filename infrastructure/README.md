# Infrastructure Setup and Management Guide

This README provides detailed instructions and guidelines for setting up and managing the infrastructure components required for the backend platform. It includes information on using Terraform for infrastructure as code, configuring CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps, and deploying services on Azure.

## Infrastructure Overview

The backend platform utilizes Azure cloud services for hosting and managing various components. The infrastructure is defined and managed using Terraform, ensuring consistency and repeatability in deployments.

Key components include:
- Azure App Service for hosting the FastAPI application
- Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- Azure Functions for data transformation tasks
- Azure Active Directory for authentication
- Azure Monitor for logging and monitoring
- Azure Blob Storage for backups and static assets
- Azure Load Balancer for traffic distribution

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the infrastructure setup, ensure you have the following:

1. Azure CLI (latest version)
2. Terraform (version 1.0.0 or later)
3. Azure DevOps account with appropriate permissions
4. Git client

## Terraform Configuration

Terraform is used to define and provision the infrastructure resources on Azure. The configuration is split into several files for better organization:

- `variables.tf`: Defines input variables used in the Terraform configuration.
- `backend.tf`: Configures the backend for storing Terraform state.
- `main.tf`: Defines the infrastructure resources to be provisioned on Azure.
- `outputs.tf`: Specifies outputs to be displayed after applying the Terraform configuration.

### Initializing Terraform

To initialize the Terraform working directory, run:

```bash
terraform init
```

This command will download the necessary provider plugins and set up the backend configuration.

### Planning Infrastructure Changes

To generate an execution plan, run:

```bash
terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

Review the plan to ensure the proposed changes are correct.

### Applying Infrastructure Changes

To apply the Terraform configuration and provision resources, run:

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

Confirm the apply action when prompted.

## Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is defined in the `azure-pipelines.yml` file. This pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes for the backend platform.

Key stages in the pipeline include:
1. Build and test the FastAPI application
2. Build and push Docker images
3. Deploy infrastructure changes using Terraform
4. Deploy the application to Azure App Service

To set up the pipeline:
1. Create a new pipeline in Azure DevOps
2. Connect to your Git repository
3. Select the `azure-pipelines.yml` file as the pipeline configuration
4. Run the pipeline

## Deployment Process

The deployment process is automated using the `deploy.sh` script. This script handles the following tasks:
1. Setting up environment variables
2. Initializing Terraform
3. Planning and applying infrastructure changes
4. Deploying the application to Azure App Service

To manually trigger a deployment, run:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

Ensure you have the necessary permissions and environment variables set before running the script.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Azure Monitor is used for monitoring the infrastructure and application performance. Key metrics and logs are collected and can be viewed in the Azure Portal.

Regular maintenance tasks include:
- Reviewing and applying security updates
- Monitoring resource usage and scaling as needed
- Reviewing and optimizing costs
- Performing regular backups and testing restore procedures

## Security Considerations

Security is a top priority for the infrastructure. Key security measures include:
- Encryption of data at rest and in transit
- Network security groups to control traffic
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing permissions
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

Ensure all team members follow security best practices and keep credentials secure.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. Terraform state conflicts:
   - Use `terraform force-unlock` if a state lock persists
   - Ensure only one person is applying changes at a time

2. Azure resource provisioning failures:
   - Check Azure resource quotas and limits
   - Review Azure service health for any ongoing issues

3. CI/CD pipeline failures:
   - Check pipeline logs for detailed error messages
   - Ensure all necessary secrets and variables are configured in Azure DevOps
